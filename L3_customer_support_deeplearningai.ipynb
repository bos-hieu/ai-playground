            "CrewAI Crews: Optimize for autonomy and collaborative intelligence, enabling you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals.\n",
            "CrewAI Flows: Enable granular, event-driven control, single LLM calls for precise task orchestration and supports Crews natively.\n",
            "With over 100,000 developers certified through our community courses, CrewAI is rapidly becoming the standard for enterprise-ready AI automation.\n",
            "​How Crews Work\n",
            "Just like a company has departments (Sales, Engineering, Marketing) working together under leadership to achieve business goals, CrewAI helps you create an organization of AI agents with specialized roles collaborating to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
